This guide provides best practices for maintaining consistent, high-quality product images across your eyewear e-commerce store.

## Image Requirements

### Technical Specifications

- **Secondary Image Resolution**: 800 x 800 pixels minimum
- **Format**: JPEG or PNG with transparent background where appropriate
- **Color Profile**: sRGB
- **File Size**: Optimize for web (less than 500KB per image recommended)

### Required Views

For each eyewear product, provide the following views:

1. **Main Front View** (required)
   - Full frontal view of the eyewear
   - Clean white background
   - No props or distractions

2. **Side View** (required) 
   - Profile view showing temple design
   - Same lighting and background as main image

3. **Top/Bottom View** (recommended)
   - Shows frame thickness and bridge design
   - Same lighting and background as main image

4. **Detail View** (recommended)
   - Close-up of notable features (logo, hinges, temple tips)
   - Same lighting and background as main image

### Professional Styling Guidelines

- Use a pure white background (RGB: 255, 255, 255)
- Maintain consistent lighting across all product images
- Position eyewear at the same angle for all similar products
- For sunglasses, show both with and without reflections
- Ensure frames are dust-free and fingerprint-free
- Use ghost mannequin technique for "on face" views (if applicable)

## Example of Optimal Product Images

```

## Image Optimization Process

1. **Pre-upload**:
   - Resize images to required dimensions
   - Optimize file size using image compression tools
   - Use consistent file naming: `[SKU]-[VIEW]-[NUMBER].jpg`

2. **During upload**:
   - Our system automatically applies additional optimization
   - Images are sorted by product category
   - Multiple sizes are generated for different display contexts

## Benefits of Following These Guidelines
